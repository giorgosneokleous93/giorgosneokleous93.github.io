### What are Full-Screen Intents?
Full-Screen [Intents](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent) are Intents that can launch in full-screen and can be used for showing a full-screen notification.

Well, I guess that needs a bit more explanation so keep on reading.

From the official [docs](https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/build-notification#urgent-message): 
> Your app might need to display an urgent, time-sensitive message, such as an incoming phone call or a ringing alarm. In these situations, you can associate a full-screen intent with your notification.

### Why should Full-Screen Intents be used?

A restriction was added with Android Q where an app couldnâ€™t start an activity if [not meeting criteria](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/background-starts#exceptions). Although this breaks a lot of things, it doesnâ€™t affect full-screen intents. (see [Restrictions on starting activities from the background](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/background-starts#display-notification))

From [Ian Lake](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1676363/ianhanniballake) from the Android Toolkit team at [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57964961/how-to-set-an-alarm-on-android-q): 
> Full screen intent has been the recommended best practice for alarms since it was introduced in API 9 and was even more important with the introduction of heads up notifications (where your alarm shows as a heads up notification if the user is actively using their device)

### When should Full-Screen Intents be used?
Full-screen intents were added to the framework since forever and it is the recommended way of launching an activity while the system is locked or busy.

**Examples:**
- **Incoming call**: When there is an incoming call, the system launches a full-screen activity if the phone is locked or shows a normal notification with high priority.
- **Alarm Clock**: An alarm clock can use full-screen intent to either show an activity or a notification with high priority.

Notifications with a Full-Screen Intent are less intrusive to the user and there is less chance to break in the future with any API changes.

### Show me the code

**Note**: On Android 10 and above to use a full-screen intent, a special [permission](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/10/behavior-changes-10#full-screen-intents) needs to be declared in the Manifest.

We are going to explore three different scenarios:
1. Notify while the app is on the foreground
2. Schedule Full-Screen Intent Notification
3. Full-Screen Intent on Lock Screen with a Keyguard

*Disclaimer*: Some logic will be emitted for demonstration purposes

### 1. Notify while the app on the foreground.

 ![Notify while the app on the foreground demo](/posts/full_screen_intent-notify-while-foreground.gif)

 In order to show a full-screen intent, we need to first build the notification and **set the full-screen intent to the notification**.

To build the intent we need a pending intent, which can be achieved using [PendingIntent](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/PendingIntent).

```kotlin
 val builder = NotificationCompat.Builder(this, channelId)
        .setSmallIcon(android.R.drawable.arrow_up_float)
        .setContentTitle(title)
        .setContentText(description)
        .setPriority(NotificationCompat.PRIORITY_HIGH)
// request code and flags not added for demo purposes
val pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, intent, 0)
builder.setFullScreenIntent(pendingIntent) // THIS HERE is the full-screen intent
```

Donâ€™t forget to add in your AndroidManifest.xmlâ€™s Activity the following as well:
```xml
<activity android:name=".LockScreenActivity"
    android:showOnLockScreen="true"/>
```

### 2. Schedule Full-Screen Intent Notification
Building the notification is identical to the previous example. The main difference is that the notification is not built by an Activity but by a [BroadcastReceiver](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver) to enable scheduling in the future using [AlarmManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager).


![Schedule Full-Screen Intent Notification demo](/posts/full_screen_intent-schedule.gif)

**Scheduling**
AlarmManager needs a PendingIntent with a BroadcastReceiver.

```kotlin
fun Context.scheduleNotification(isLockScreen: Boolean) {
    val alarmManager = getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE) as AlarmManager
    val timeInMillis = System.currentTimeMillis() + TimeUnit.SECONDS.toMillis(SCHEDULE_TIME)
    with(alarmManager) {
        setExact(AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP, timeInMillis, getReceiver(isLockScreen))
    }
}
private fun Context.getReceiver(isLockScreen: Boolean): PendingIntent {
    // for demo purposes no request code and no flags
    return PendingIntent.getBroadcast(
        this,
        0,
        NotificationReceiver.build(this, isLockScreen),
        0
    )
}

```

**Receiver**
The Receiver below is called in two cases:
- When the system is locked
- When the system is not locked

```kotlin
class NotificationReceiver : BroadcastReceiver() {
    override fun onReceive(context: Context, intent: Intent) {
        if(intent.getBooleanExtra(LOCK_SCREEN_KEY, true)) {
            context.showNotificationWithFullScreenIntent(true)
        } else {
            context.showNotificationWithFullScreenIntent()
        }
    }
    companion object {
        fun build(context: Context, isLockScreen: Boolean): Intent {
            return Intent(context, NotificationReceiver::class.java).also {
                it.putExtra(LOCK_SCREEN_KEY, isLockScreen)
            }
        }
    }
}
private const val LOCK_SCREEN_KEY = "lockScreenKey"
```

### 3. Full-Screen Intent on Lock Screen with a Keyguard

[Keyguard](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/KeyguardManager) could prevent the notification from being displayed.

Letâ€™s see an example to visualize it.

![Full-Screen Intent on Lock Screen with a Keyguard demo blocker](/posts/full_screen_intent-keyguard-blocker.gif)

The framework provides some flags to dismiss keyguard.

Activity#[setShowWhenLocked](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#setShowWhenLocked(boolean))(true) method
Note: To be able to turn on the screen we need to also request it using the:

â€“ Activity#[setTurnScreenOn](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#setTurnScreenOn(boolean))(true) method

Time for an extension function that sets both flags with backward compatibility ðŸš€

```kotlin
fun Activity.turnScreenOnAndKeyguardOff() {
    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.O_MR1) {
        setShowWhenLocked(true)
        setTurnScreenOn(true)
    } else {
        window.addFlags(
            WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON
                    or WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_ALLOW_LOCK_WHILE_SCREEN_ON
        )
    }
    with(getSystemService(Context.KEYGUARD_SERVICE) as KeyguardManager) {
        if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.O) {
            requestDismissKeyguard(this@turnScreenOnAndKeyguardOff, null)
        }
    }
}
```

### Conclusion
Using Full-Screen Intents is easy and itâ€™s the recommended way of launching an activity, especially for alarms.

The API should be used with care, and developers shouldnâ€™t abuse it as itâ€™s quite intrusive especially when the screen wakes up.
